# Exercise Overview

## Introduction

The exercises are used to show different aspects of Xamarin and Visual Studio that are relevant for DevOps. The goal is to have a consistent sample that attendees can build step by step. The sample is simple so that everybody can follow. However, it contains some requirements and implementation details that are typical for mobile applications.

## Goal of the Sample

The sample is taken from [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) and built with Xamarin Forms, the original version can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/softawaregmbh/Hanselman.Forms).

The goal of the sample is to see blog posts and tweets by Scott Hanselman. Due to Xamarin Forms the app is available on iOS, Android, Windows, Android Wear and Apple Watch.
